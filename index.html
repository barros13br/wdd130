        <p>Hi! My name is Antonio, and I’m from São Paulo, Brazil.
            I currently work in customer support at Samsung, where I help customers solve technical issues and ensure
            they have a
            great experience with our products and services. This role has helped me develop strong communication,
            problem-solving,
            and teamwork skills, as well as a deeper understanding of the technology industry.</p>
        <p>I’ve been happily married for about seven months, and I truly value the partnership and balance that marriage
            has
            brought into my life.</p>
        <p>I’m also studying Software Engineering at BYU Idaho, and learning a lot about technology.</p>

            <p>São Paulo is Brazil’s most populous and economically developed state, known as the country’s financial
                and industrial
                powerhouse.</p>
            <p>Its capital, also named São Paulo, is a vibrant metropolis famous for its cultural diversity, gastronomy,
                and dynamic
                nightlife.</p>
            <p>Beyond the city, the state features beautiful countryside, historic towns, and stunning coastal beaches.
